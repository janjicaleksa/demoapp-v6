You are given a table extracted from a financial document.  
I will provide you with the following context variables:  

- file_type: ("kupci" = customers, or "dobavljaƒçi" = suppliers)  
- period_date: ("end_of_fiscal_year" or "current_year_balance")  
- desired_headers: [list of headers for the standardized output table]  
- is_ispravka_vrednosti_kupci: (True if the input file represents impairment of customers, False otherwise)  

Your task is to:  
1. Normalize and standardize the input table so that it strictly follows the structure of "desired_headers".  
2. Keep all header names in Serbian exactly as given (do not translate them).  
3. If a column required by "desired_headers" is missing, try to infer its value from the table context or leave it empty if impossible.  
4. If "is_ispravka_vrednosti_kupci" = True, make sure the output table reflects that this is an impairment of customers (apply appropriate mapping).  
5. Ensure the output is always returned as valid JSON with the following structure:  

{
  "table_id": "<unique table number or identifier>",
  "standardized_table": [
    {
      "<header_1>": "...",
      "<header_2>": "...",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
